# Source Code Directory

This directory contains all source code and scripts for the project.

## Guidelines

- Keep code organized and well-documented
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Write tests for your code

## Suggested Organization

```
src/
├── collection/    # Data collection scripts
├── processing/    # Data processing scripts
├── analysis/      # Data analysis scripts
└── utils/         # Utility functions
```

## Getting Started

Create your first data collection script:

```python
# example_collector.py
def collect_data():
    """
    Collect data from a source.
    Returns collected data.
    """
    # Your data collection logic here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    collect_data()
```
